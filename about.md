My PGP key: see [here](../PGPKey).

So you found this page... Unfortunately, there isn't much to say about me.

1. Before you ask, my alias `Chocobo1` is from the name of the creature `Chocobo` ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocobo), [[2]](https://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Chocobo)) which is featured in [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy) series.

2. I only use this alias at [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). If you saw it elsewhere, certainly, thats not me.
