title: File verification with GnuPG
---

To ensure the files you downloaded *from me* are not tampered by the evil, you can use [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) to verify it.

Here are some simple steps for you to follow:

## 1. Import public key

* Import manually:

  Download my [public key](../public.asc) and then import it to gpg:
  ```shell
  gpg --import public.asc
  ```

* Or you can get it via keyserver:
  ```shell
  gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys F5380EA79A2C21C3687500B6BB350F9E0D2B1137
  ```

* More information on key server: [link](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xBB350F9E0D2B1137)

## 2. Verify key fingerprint

Run
```shell
gpg --fingerprint Chocobo1@users.noreply.github.com
```

Make sure the printed fingerprint on your screen match with the following:
```shell
F538 0EA7 9A2C 21C3 6875  00B6 BB35 0F9E 0D2B 1137
```


## 3. File verification

Let's assume you downloaded `abc.exe` and wish to verify it.

Before verification, you must also download the accompany signature file `abc.exe.sig` (or `abc.exe.asc`).
Put it in the same directory as `abc.exe`.

Then run:
```shell
gpg --verify abc.exe.sig  # or abc.exe.asc
```

If the files are NOT tampered, you should see the following:
```text
gpg: Good signature from "Chocobo1 <Chocobo1@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

Verification FAILED example:
```text
gpg: BAD signature from "Chocobo1 <Chocobo1@users.noreply.github.com>"
```
